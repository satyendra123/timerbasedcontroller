# let's suppose ki mere ghar me ek motor hai mai chahta hu ki wo motor daily morning me 6 baje apne se chalu ho jaye aur kuch time ke bad autocut ho jaye. to iske liye mai simply kya karunga ki ntp(network time protocol) ka use karunga time set karne ke liye. lekin iske liye hume internet chahiye so hum use krenge wifi library isme
#EXAMPLE-1
from machine import Pin
import time
import network
import ntptime

# Configure relay
relay_pin = Pin(26, Pin.OUT)  # Digital pin for relay

# Connect to Wi-Fi
ssid = 'YOUR_WIFI_SSID'
password = 'YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD'
station = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
station.active(True)
station.connect(ssid, password)
while not station.isconnected():
    pass

# Synchronize time
ntptime.settime()

# Main loop
while True:
    # Get current time
    current_time = time.localtime()

    # Check if it's 6 am
    if current_time[3] == 6 and current_time[4] == 0:
        relay_pin.value(1)  # Turn on relay
        time.sleep(10)  # Keep relay on for 10 seconds
        relay_pin.value(0)  # Turn off relay

        # Wait until next day
        while current_time[3] == 6 and current_time[4] == 0:
            current_time = time.localtime()

    # Wait for the next minute
    time.sleep(60 - current_time[5])  # Wait for the remaining seconds until the next minute
